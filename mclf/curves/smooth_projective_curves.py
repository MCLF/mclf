Smooth projective curves over a field.
======================================

Let `k` be a field and `F/k` a finitely generated field extension of transcendence
degree one (i.e. a 'function field over `k`'). Then there exists a smooth projective
curve `X` over `Spec(k)` with function field `F`, unique up to unique isomorphism.
The set of closed points on `X` are in natural bijection with the set of discrete
valuations on `F` which are trivial on `k`. See

- R. Hartshorne, *Algebraic Geometry*, Theorem I.6.9.

The classes in this module provide the definition and some basic functionality for
such curves.

A curve `X` is defined via its function field `F_X`. Points are represented by
the corresponding valuations on `F_X`, and no smooth projective model of `X` is
actually computed. However, we do compute a list of 'coordinate functions'
`x_1,..,x_n` which separate all points, meaning that the closure of the rational
map from `X` to projective space of dimension `n` is injective. Then a (closed)
point `x` on `X` can also be represented by the tupel `(f_1(x),..,f_n(x))`.

A function field in Sage is always realized as a simple separable extension of a
rational function field. Geometrically, this means that the curve `X` is implicitly
equipped with a finite separable morphism `\phi:X\to\mathbb{P}^1_k`
to the projective line over the base field `k`.

The base field `k` is called the *constant base field* of the curve, and it is
part of the data. We do not assume that the extension `F_X/k` is regular (i.e.
that `k` is algebraically closed in `F_X`). Geometrically this means that the
curve `X` may not be absolutely irreducibel as a `k`-scheme. The 'field of
constants' of `X` is defined as the algebraic closure of `k` inside `F_X`.
It is a finite extension `k_c/k`. If we regard `X` as a curve over its fields of
constants then it becomes absolute irreducible.

It would be interesting to have an efficient algorithm for computing the field
of constants, but it seems that this has not been implemented in Sage yet.
To compute the genus of `X` it is necessary to know at least the degree `[k_c:k]`.
We have implemented a probabilistic algorithm for computing the degree `[k_c:k]`
(if `k` is finite, this determines `k_c` uniquely).

EXAMPLES::

    sage: from mclf import *
    sage: K = GF(2)
    sage: FX.<x> = FunctionField(K)
    sage: R.<T> = FX[]
    sage: FY.<y> = FX.extension(T^2+x^2*T+x^5+x^3)
    sage: Y = SmoothProjectiveCurve(FY)
    sage: Y
    The smooth projective curve over Finite Field of size 2 with Function field in y defined by y^2 + x^2*y + x^5 + x^3.
    sage: Y.genus()
    1
    sage: Y.zeta_function()
    (2*T^2 + T + 1)/(2*T^2 - 3*T + 1)


.. TODO::

    - write more doctests !!
    - implement an algorithm for computing the field of constants
      (and not just the degree)
    - the residue field of a point should be explicitly an extension of
      the constant base field.
    - treat the base curve `X` as a *curve*, not just as a function field
    - realize morphisms between curves, in particular the canonical to `X`
