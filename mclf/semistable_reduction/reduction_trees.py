Reduction trees:
================
a data structure for semistable reduction of covers of the projective line.
===========================================================================

Let `K` be a field with a discrete valuation `v_K`. We let `X:=\mathbb{P}^1_K`
denote the projective line over `K`. We are also given a finite cover

.. MATH::

      \phi: Y \to X,

where `Y` is a smooth projective and absolutely irreducible curve. We assume that
`Y` has positive genus.

Let `\mathcal{X}_0` be a (normal) `\v_K`-model of `X`. Then for every finite
field extension `L/K` and every extension `v_L` of `v_K` to `L`, we obtain
`v_L`-models `\mathcal{X}` of `X_L` and `\mathcal{Y}` of `Y_L` and a finite map
`\mathcal{Y}\to\mathcal{X}` extending `\phi` by normalizing `\mathcal{X}_0`.
Restricting this map to the special fiber yields a finite map

.. MATH::

         \bar{\phi}: \bar{Y} \to \bar{X}

between projective curves over the residue field of `v_L`. We call this the
*reduction* of `\phi` *over* `L` with respect to `v_L` the *inertial model*
`\mathcal{X}_0`.

If we fix `\phi` and `\mathcal{X}_0` then there exists `(L,v_L)` such that the
curves `\bar{Y}` and `\bar{X}` are reduced. If this is the case, any further
extension of `(L,v_L)` will not change `\bar{Y}` and `\bar{X}` in an essential
way (more precisely, it will only replace `\bar{Y}` and `\bar{X}` by their
base extensions to the larger residue field). Therefore we call the models
`\mathcal{Y}` and `\mathcal{X}` *permanent*.

We say that `\mathcal{X}_0` is a *semistable inertial model* of `\phi` if
the permanent models `\mathcal{Y}` and `\mathcal{X}` are semistable, and
all irreducible components of the (semistable) curves `\bar{Y}` and `\bar{X}`
are smooth (i.e. they do not intersect themselves).

The class ``ReductionTree`` defined in this module is a datastructure which
encodes a cover `\phi:Y\to X` and an inertial model `\mathcal{X}_0` as above,
and provides functionality for computing the reduction
`\bar{\phi}:\bar{Y}\to\bar{X}` with respect to extensions `(L,v_L)`. In
particular, it allows us to check whether the given inertial model `\mathcal{X}_0`
is semistable and, if this is the case, to compute the semistable reduction of
the curve `Y`.

EXAMPLES::

    sage: from mclf import *
    sage: FX.<x> = FunctionField(QQ)
    sage: v_2 = pAdicValuation(QQ, 2)
    sage: X = BerkovichLine(FX, v_2)
    sage: T = BerkovichTree(X, X.gauss_point())
    sage: T, _ = T.add_point(X.infty())
    sage: R.<y> = FX[]
    sage: FY.<y> = FX.extension(y^2-x^3-1)
    sage: Y = SmoothProjectiveCurve(FY)
    sage: RT = ReductionTree(Y, v_2, T)
    sage: RT.add_reduction_component(T.root())
    sage: Z = RT.reduction_components()[0]
    sage: Z
    base component of reduction tree with interior Elementary affinoid defined by
    v(x) >= 0

TODO:

- if we create a reduction tree from a tree `T`, there should be certain
  requirements on `T` which insure that it makes sense. For instance, if
  we mark a vertex as a ``BaseComponent``, then the interior of this component
  should be well defined.
- if we allow adding new vertices to the tree, then it must be made sure that
  the above requirements are kept, and all the adjustements which we do to the
  tree must be passed on to the base components.
- Maybe it is safer to not allow any adjustements to the tree at all.
