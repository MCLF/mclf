Reduction trees: a data structure for reduction of covers of the projective line.
=================================================================================

Let `K` be a field with a discrete valuation `v_K`. We let `X:=\mathbb{P}^1_K`
denote the projective line over `K`. We are also given a finite cover

.. MATH::

      \phi: Y \to X,

where `Y` is a smooth projective and absolutely irreducible curve. We assume that
`Y` has positive genus.

A **reduction** of the cover `\phi` over `v_K` is given by the
following data:

- a finite extension `L/K`,
- an extension `v_L` of `v_K` to `L`,
- normal models `\mathcal{X},\mathcal{Y}` of `X_L, Y_L` (with respect to `v_L`),
- a finite morphism `\Phi_L: \mathcal{Y} \to \mathcal{X}` extending `\phi`.

  Restriction of `\Phi_L` to the special fibers yields a finite
  morphism

.. MATH::

    \bar{\phi}: \bar{Y} \to \bar{X}

between (not necessarily smooth) curves over the residue field of `L`. This map
is often called a *reduction* of the cover `\phi`, by abuse of
terminology.

A reduction `\Phi_L` is called **Galois** if

- the extension `L/K` is Galois (with Galois group `G`), and
- the natural action of the decomposition group `G_{v_L}\subset G` of `v_L`
  on `Y_L` extends to the model `\mathcal{Y}`.

If this is the case, then we can form the quotient schemes
`\mathcal{X}_0:=\mathcal{X}/G_{v_L}` and `\mathcal{Y}_0:=\mathcal{Y}/G_{v_L}`.
There is then a natural finite and `G_{v_K}`-invariant morphism

.. MATH::

     \Phi_0:\mathcal{Y}_0\to\mathcal{X}_0,

called the **Galois invariant model** of the reduction. A crucial point
of our method is that the reduction `\Phi_L` is uniquely determined by the
following data:

- the `v_K`- model `\mathcal{X}_0` of `X=\mathbb{P}^1_K`, and
- the Galois extension `L/K`, and
- the extension `v_L` of `v_K` to `L`.

To see this, note that `\mathcal{Y}` and `\mathcal{X}` are the normalization of
`\mathcal{X}_0` inside the function fields `F(Y_L)` and `F(X_L)=L(x)`,
respectively, localized at `v_L`.

Conversely, given any normal `v_K`-model `\mathcal{X}_0` of `X`, a Galois
extension `L/K` and an extension `v_L` of `v_K` to `L`, normalization yields a
Galois-invariant reduction `\Phi_L` of `\phi` at `v_L`.

To summarize the discussion up to this point: the reduction of a cover
`\phi:Y\to X` at a place `v_K` can be described solely by a normal `v_K`-model
of the projective line `X`.

This module realizes a base class ``ReductionTree`` which is able to store
the essential information about a reduction of a cover `\phi`. It also provides
some general functionality for extracting this information.

Essentially, a ``ReductionTree`` is a ``BerkovichTree`` (see ??), together with
some extra information.
