Reduction trees: a data structure for semistable reduction of covers of the projective line.
============================================================================================

Let `K` be a field with a discrete valuation `v_K`. We let `X:=\mathbb{P}^1_K`
denote the projective line over `K`. We are also given a finite cover

.. MATH::

      \phi: Y \to X,

where `Y` is a smooth projective and absolutely irreducible curve. We assume that
`Y` has positive genus.

Let `\mathcal{X}_0` be a (normal) `v_K`-model of `X`. Then for every finite
field extension `L/K` and every extension `v_L` of `v_K` to `L`, we obtain
`v_L`-models `\mathcal{X}` of `X_L` and `\mathcal{Y}` of `Y_L` and a finite map
`\mathcal{Y}\to\mathcal{X}` extending `\phi` by normalizing `\mathcal{X}_0`.
Restricting this map to the special fiber yields a finite map

.. MATH::

         \bar{\phi}: \bar{Y} \to \bar{X}

between projective curves over the residue field of `v_L`. We call this the
*reduction* of `\phi` *over* `(L,v_L)` with respect to the *inertial model*
`\mathcal{X}_0`.

If we fix `\phi` and `\mathcal{X}_0` then there exists `(L,v_L)` such that the
curves `\bar{Y}` and `\bar{X}` are reduced. If this is the case, any further
extension of `(L,v_L)` will not change `\bar{Y}` and `\bar{X}` in an essential
way (more precisely, it will only replace `\bar{Y}` and `\bar{X}` by their
base extensions to the larger residue field). Therefore we call the models
`\mathcal{Y}` and `\mathcal{X}` *permanent*.

We say that `\mathcal{X}_0` is a *semistable inertial model* of `\phi` if
the permanent models `\mathcal{Y}` and `\mathcal{X}` are semistable, and
all irreducible components of the (semistable) curves `\bar{Y}` and `\bar{X}`
are smooth (i.e. they do not intersect themselves).

The class ``ReductionTree`` defined in this module is a datastructure which
encodes a cover `\phi:Y\to X` and an inertial model `\mathcal{X}_0` as above,
and provides functionality for computing the reduction
`\bar{\phi}:\bar{Y}\to\bar{X}` with respect to extensions `(L,v_L)`. In
particular, it allows us to check whether the given inertial model `\mathcal{X}_0`
is semistable and, if this is the case, to compute the semistable reduction of
the curve `Y`.


**The inertial model**

The inertial model `\mathcal{X}_0` of `X` is determined by a *Berkovich tree*
`T` on the analytic space `X^{an}` (the *Berkovich line* over `\hat{K}`, the
completion of `K` with respect to `v_K`). Thus,

* the irreducible components of the special fiber of `\mathcal{X}_0` (called
  the *inertial components*) correspond to the vertices of `T` which are points
  of type II on `X^{an}`.
* the vertices of `T` which are points of type I (i.e. closed points on `X`)
  are considered *marked points* on `X`
* an edge of `T` connecting two points of type II correspond to the point
  of intersection of the two corresponding inertial components
* an edge of `T` connecting a point of type II and a point of type II corresponds
  to the specialization of a marked point to an inertial component

In particular, the inertial model `\mathcal{X}_0` is a *marked* model. As a
result, the models `\mathcal{X}` and `\mathcal{Y}` induced by `\mathcal{X}_0`
and an extension `(L,v_L)` are marked models, too. The condition that
`\mathcal{X}_0` is a semistable inertial model therefore implies that `\mathcal{X}`
and `\mathcal{Y}` are *marked* semistable models, for `L/K` sufficiently large.
Recall that this means that the marked points specialize to the smooth points
on the special fiber.


**Reduction components**

Let us fix an inertial component `Z_0`. The *interior* of `Z_0` is the affinoid
subdomain of `X^{an}` consisting of all points which specialize to a point on
`Z_0` which is neither the point of intersection with another inertial component
nor the specialization of a marked point (exception: if there is a unique
inertial component and no marking then this is all of `X^{an}` and not an
affinoid). We have to choose a *basepoint* for `Z_0`, which is a closed point on
`X` lying inside the interior. This choice is made in a heuristic manner;
the degree of the base point should be as small as possible. Then a *splitting
field* for `Z_0` is a finite extension `(L,v_L)` of `(K,v_K)` with the property
that the base point and all points on `Y` above it are `\hat{L}`-rational (where
`\hat{L}` denotes the completion of `L` with respect to `v_L`).
