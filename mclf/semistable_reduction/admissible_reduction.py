Admissible reduction of curves
==============================

Let `K` be a field equipped with a discrete valuation `v_K`. For the time being,
we assume that `K` is a number field. Then `v_K` is the `\mathfrak{p}`-adic
valuation corresponding to a prime ideal `\mathfrak{p}` of `K`.

We consider a smooth projective  curve `Y` over `K`. Our goal is to compute the
semistable reduction of `Y` at `v_K` and to extract nontrivial arithmetic
information on `Y` from this.

In this module we realize a class ``AdmissibleModel``
which computes the semistable reduction of a given curve `Y` at `v_K` provided
that it has *admissible reduction* at `v_K`. This is always the case if the
residue characteristic of `v_K` is zero or strictly larger than the degree
of `Y` (as a cover of the projective line).

class AdmissibleModel(SemistableModel):
    r"""
    A class representing a curve `Y` over a field `K` with a discrete valuation
    `v_K`. Assuming that `Y` has (potentially) admissible reduction at `v_K`,
    we are able to compute the semistable reduction of `Y` at `v_K`.

    INPUT:

    - ``Y`` -- a smooth projective curve over a field `K`
    - ``vK`` -- a discrete valuation on `K`

    OUTPUT: the object representing the curve `Y` and the valuation `v_K`.
    This object has various functionalities to compute the semistable reduction
    of `Y` relative to `v_K`, and some arithmetic invariants associated to it
    (for instance the "exponent of conductor" of `Y` with respect to `v_K`).
