Elements of p-adic number fields
================================

In this module we define classes whose objects are elements of p-adic number
fields. We do not intend to equip these elements with the usual arithmetic
operations `+` etc. Our modest goal is to able to perform the following tasks
with elements of a `p`-adic number field:

- compute valuations and distances (i.e. valuation of the difference of two
  elements),
- evaluate a polynomial with rational coefficients on an element,
- compute the minimal polynomial of algebraic elements,
- compute the image of a field element under an embedding of p-adic number
  fields.

Recall that for us, a p-adic number field `K` is given as the completion of
an absolute number field `K_0` with respect to a discrete valuation `v_K`, with
finite residue characteristic `p`. We assume that `v_K` is  the only extension
of the `p`-adic valuation from `\mathbb{Q}` to `K_0`; hence

.. MATH::

    [K:\mathbb{Q}_p] = [K_0:\mathbb{Q}].

Moreover, we assume that the powers of the standard generator of
`K_0/\mathbb{Q}` form an integral basis of `K/\mathbb{Q}_p`, so that

.. MATH::

    \mathcal{O}_K = \mathbb{Z}_p[\alpha],

where `\alpha` is the standard generator of `K_0/\mathbb{Q}`.

By an *element* of `K` we mean on of the following three types of objects:

- An *exact element*: this is just an element of the underlying number
  field `K_0`.
- An *approximate element*: this is an element of `K` only known up to some
  given precision. More precisely, it is a closed ball inside `K`.
- An *algebraic element*: an element of `K` which is algebraic over `\mathbb{Q}`;
  such an element can by specified by its minimal polynomial and a
  sufficiently good approximation in `K_0`.

Actually, we treat the first case as a boundary case of the second, where the
precision takes the value `\infty`.
