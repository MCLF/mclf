Extension of `p`-adic number fields
===================================


In this module we define a class ``pAdicExtension``, which realizes a finite
extension `L/K` of `p`-adic number fields. Both fields `K` and `L` are realized
as objects in the class :class:`pAdicNumberField`, the embedding `K\to L` as
an object of ``pAdicEmbedding``.

The class :class:`pAdicExtension` is actually a subclass of
:class:`pAdicNumberField`, emphazising the point of view that we may regard
an extension `L/K` as an *absolute* `p`-adic number field, or as a *relative*
`p`-adic number field with base field `K`.
