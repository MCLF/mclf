Approximate factorization of polynomials over `p`-adic number fields
====================================================================

Let `K` be a `p`-adic number field and `f\in K[x]` an univariate polynomial over
`K`. A key task for us is to compute the splitting field `L/K` of `f` and
various intermediate fields (e.g. the stem fields of the prime factors of `f`).

Recall that we realize `K` internally by choosing a dense subfield `K_0\subset K`
and then try to do all computations with `K_0` and the valuation `v_K` on `K_0`
induced by the `p`adic valuation of `K`. Even if the given polynomial `f` has
coefficients in `K_0`, its irreducible factors may not be defined over `K_0`.
Fortunately, by Krasner's Lemma, it suffices to work with sufficiently good
approximations of the irreducible factors of `f`, and these can be chosen to
be defined over `K_0`.

In this module we implement the concept of an *approximate irreducible* factor
of a polynomial over a `p`-adic number field.

**Definition 1**

    Let `f\in K[x]` be a separable polynomial over `K`, of degree `>1`. Let `R_f`
    denote the set of roots of `f` (in some algebraic closure of `K`).
    The *fineness* of `f` is the positive rational number

    ..MATH::

        \mu(f) := \max\{ v_K(\alpha-\beta) \mid \alpha,\beta\in R_f, \alpha\neq \beta\}.
    For polynomials of degree one we set `\mu(f):=0`.

Note that `\mu(f)` is invariant under extension of the base field `K`.

**Definition**

    Let `f,g \in K[x]` be polynomials over `K`. Assume that `g` is monic,
    integral, irreducible and of degree `\geq 2`. We say that `g` is an
    *approximate prime factor* of `f` if for every root  `\alpha` of `g` there
    exists a root `\beta` of `f` which is strictly closer to `\alpha` than to
    any other root of `g`. If, moreover, `\deg(g)=\deg(f)` then `f` and `g` are
    called *Krasner equivalent`.

    An *approximate prime factor* over `K` is a Krasner equivalence class of
    polynomials `g\in K[x]` which are monic, integral, irreducible and of degree
    `\geq 2`.

    An *approximate irreducible factor* is a Krasner equivalence class of monic,
    integral and irreducible polynomials `g` which are *approximate prime factors*

    a root `\beta` of `f` which is strictly closer to `\alpha` than all other
    roots of `g`.

        It may be usefull to allow `v_0` to be an *enhanced valuation*.

    r""" An  approximation of a monic, integral and irreducible polynomial

    More precisely, this object represents a *Krasner equivalence class* of
    polynomials (see below).

    INPUT:

    - ``K`` -- a p-adic number field
    - ``f`` -- data defining an equivalence class of irreducible, monic and
               integral polynomials over `K`

    The data defining `f` can be of the following form:

    1. a polynomial over the number field `K_0` underlying `K` which is
      - monic and integral
      - irreducible over `K`
    2. an infinite pseudovaluation `v` on `K_0[x]`
    3. a separating *enhanced* inductive valuation on `K[x]`

    It is clear that a polynomial `f\in K_0[x]` satisfying the conditions in (1)
    determines a unique pseudovaluation `v_f` on `K_0[x]` such that `v_f(f)=\infty`.
    Conversely, an infinite pseudovaluation `v` determines a unique irreducible
    polynomial `f\in K[x]`, but the coefficients of `f` may not lie in `K_0`
    (in this case, `v` is defined as a limit valuation).

    Let `f_1,f_2\in K[x]` be two polynomials satisfying (1). We say
    that `f_1` and `f_2` are *Krasner equivalent* if they have the same degree,
    and for any root `\alpha` of `f_1` there exists a unique root `\beta` of
    `f_2` which is strictly closer to `alpha` than any other root of `f_1`.
    Then by Krasner's Lemma, the stem field `L=K(\alpha)` of `f_1` does only
    depend on the equivalence class of `f_1`.

    So if the input is as in (1) or (2), the object that is returned represents
    the Krasner equivalence class defined by the input.

    Let `v = [v_0,v(\phi)=t]` be an enhanced inductive valuation, which is an
    augmentation of `v_0` with key polynomial `\phi` (by enhanced we mean that
    the `v`-equivalence class of key polynomials containing `\phi` is part of
    data). We call `v` *separating* if the set of distinguished key polynomials
    is contained in a Krasner equivalence class. It is called *strictly separating*
    if it is equal to a Krasner equivalence class.

    Given a separating enhanced valuation `v`, there exists a unique strictly
    separating enhanced valuation `v_0` whose equivalence class contains the
    equivalence class of `v`. We call `v_0` the **root** of `v`.

    So if the input is as in (3) it defines a Krasner equivalence class as
    well. Conversely, a Krasner equivalence class gives rise to a unique
    strictly separating enhanced valuation. It is called the **root** of
    the Krasner class.
