Simple extensions of p-adic number fields
=========================================

In this module we implement a constructor class for finite simple extensions
of p-adic number fields.

Let `K` be a p-adic number field and `f\in K[x]` be a monic, irreducible and
integral polynomial. We wish to construct the stem field

.. MATH::

    L:= K(\alpha) \cong K[x]/(f)

of `f`, as a p-adic number field, and as an extension of `K`.

Recall that a p-adic number field `K` is represented as a pair `(K_0,v_K)`,
where `K_0` is a number field and `v_K` a p-adic valuation on `K_0`, such that
`K` is the completion of `K_0` with respect to `v_K`. As `K_0` is dense in `K`,
we may assume that `f\in K_0[x]` (actually, the polynomial `f` represents a
*Krasner class*, see :module:`approximate_factorizations<mclf.padic_extensions.\
approximate_factorizations>`). This suggests defining `L` as the pair
`(L_0, v_L)`, where

.. MATH::

    L_0 := K_0[x]/(f)

is the stem field of `f` and `v_L` is the unique extension of `v_K` to `L_0`
(the uniqueness is guaranteed since `f` is irreducible over `K` by assumption).

However, there are serious drawbacks of this naive approach. For one thing,
working with relative number fields of high degree in Sage is prohibitively
slow. Also, the construction of `L_0` as a stem field of `f` over `K_0` will
typically violate the condition (imposed in :module:`padic_number_fields\
<mclf.padic_extensions.padic_number_fields>`) that the canonical generator
of `L_0` is also an integral generator with respect to `v_L`.

We offer two different solutions to these problems. The first one, the result
of which we call the **exact extension** is as follows. We start by finding
a polynomial in `K_0[x]` (of small degree) whose image `\beta'` in
`L_0':=K_0[x]/(f)` is an (absolute) integral `p`-adic generator. The existence
of such an element is guaranteed by Lemma II.10.4 in Neukirch's book, and the
proofs gives a simple recipe for finding it. Then we compute the absolute
minimal polynomial `g\in\mathbb{Q}[x]` of `\beta'` and set

.. MATH::

    L_0 := \mathbb{Q}(\beta) = K_0[x]/(g).

By construction, `L_0` has a unique `p`-adic valuation `v_L` and the canonical
generator `\beta` is an integral generator w.r.t. `v_L`. Therefore, we can
define the completion `L` of `L_0` at `v_L` as a p-adic number field. Moreover,
the isomorphism `L_0'=K_0[x]/(f)\cong L_0`, sending `\beta'` to `\beta`,
defines an embedding of number fields `K_0\hookrightarrow L_0` which in turn
induces an embedding of p-adic number fields `K\hookrightarrow L`.

It turns out that this approach is still feasible for moderate degrees but is
too slow for large degrees. The problem is that the coefficients of the polynomial
`g` defining `L_0`, and the coefficients defining the embedding of `K_0` into
`L_0` become too large. The actual bottleneck is .... (find out!).

The second solution, which is the prefered one, is called the **approximate
extension**. We roughly proceed as above, but we compute the minimal polynomial
`g` of `\beta'` only *approximately*. If this approximation is sufficiently
sharp, the resulting p-adic number field `L` still has an embedding
`\varphi:K\hookrightarrow L` such that the resulting extension `L/K` is a stem
field for `f`. However, this embedding will typically not be induced by an
embedding of the underlying number fields.

In this second approach, the two most expensive computations, which are

- computing the characteristic polynomial of the matrix representing the
  element `\beta'` (in order to find the polynomial `g`), and
- solving a linear equation `A\cdot x = v` (in order to find the embedding of
  `K_0` into `L_0`)

are done over a quotient ring `\mathbb{Z}/p^s\mathbb{Z}`, where `s` is a
(small) positive integer (called the *precision*). So the speed-up compared
to the first approach is entirely due to the prevention of coefficient growth.

.. NOTE::

    Currently, we work with a fixed precision `s:=5`, and this seems to work in
    all examples considered so far. What is still missing is the automatism of
    increasing the precision if the computation fails or, better, an a priori
    estimate of a sufficient precision. So our current implementation may fail
    to compute the extensions, but if it doesn't the result is provably correct.


.. TODO::

    - make sure that we work with sufficient precision
    - also compute a root `\alpha\in L` of `f` along the way
