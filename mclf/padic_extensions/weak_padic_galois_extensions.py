r"""  Weak p-adic Galois extensions

Let `\hat{K}` be a `p`-adic number field. For our project we need to be able to
compute with Galois extensions `\hat{L]/}`\hat{K}` of large ramification degree.
For instance, we need to be able to compute the breaks of the ramification
filtration of the Galois group of `\hat{L}/\hat{K}`, as well as the corresponding
subfields.

At the moment, computations with large Galois extensions of `p`-adic fields are
still problematic. In particular, it seems difficult to obtain results which are
provably correct. For this reason we do not work which `p`-adic numbers at all.
Instead, we approximate `p`-adic fields by pairs `(K, v_K)`, where `K` is  a
number field and `v_K` a `p`-adic valuation on `K`. Given any finite extension
`\hat{L}/\hat{K}`, there always exists a finite extension `L/K` and an extension
`v_L` of `v_K` such that `\hat{L}` is the completion of `L` and `v_L` (this is
an easy consequence of Krasner's lemma).

From a more abstract point of view our approach means that
we work with the **henselization** `K^h` of `K` at `v_K`. Since we are mostly
interested in ramification, we may also consider the **strict** henselization
`K^{sh}` of `K` with respect to `v_K`, i.e. the maximal unramified extension
of `K^h`.

Let `L/K` be a finite field extension and `v_L` an extension of `v_K` to `L`.
We say that `L/K` is a **weak Galois extension** (with respect to `v_L`)
if `L^{sh}/K^{sh}` is Galois. Given a polynomial `f` in `K[x]`, we say that
`L/K` is a **weak splitting field** for `f` if `f` splits over `L^{sh}`.

Given a weak Galois extension `L/K`, we have canonical isomorphisms between the
following groups:

- the Galois group of `L^{sh}/K^{sh]}`,
- the inertia subgroup of the Galois closure of `\hat{L}/\hat{K}`,
- the inertia subgroup of the Galois closure of `L/K`, with respect to some
    extension of `v_K`.

Moreover, these isomorphisms respect the filtrations by higher ramification
groups.

If `L/K` is totally ramified then the degree of `L/K` is equal to the degree
of `L^{sh}/K^{sh}`, which is equal to the order of the inertia subgroup of the
Galois closure of `\hat{L}/\hat{K}`. Therefore, our approach allows us to fully
understand the inertia group of a Galois extension of `p`-adic fields, while
keeping the degree of the field extensions with which one works as small as
possible.

Our method can also be used to work with approximations of the subfields
of a `p`-adic Galois extension corresponding to the higher ramification
subgroups.

For `u\geq 0` we let `L^{sh,u}` denote the subfield of `L^{sh}/K^{sh}`
corresponding to the `u`th filtration step of the Galois group of
`L^{sh}/K^{sh}`. Then the completion of `L^{sh,u}` agrees with the maximal
unramified extension of the subextension `\hat{L}^u` of the Galois closure
`\hat{L}/\hat{K}` corresponding to the `u`th ramification step. Moreover,
there exists a finite extensions `L^u/K`, together with an extension `v_{L^u}`
of `v_K` to `L^u` such that

- the strict henselization of `(L^u, v_{L^u})` is isomorphic to `L^{sh,u}`,
- the completion of `(L^u, v_{L^u})` agrees with `\hat{L}^u`, up to a finite
  unramified extension.

Note that `L^u` will in general not be a subfield of `L` (and not even of the
Galois closure of `L/K`).


In this module we define a class ``WeakPadicGaloisExtension``, which realizes an
approximation of a `p`-adic Galois extension, up to unramified extensions.
