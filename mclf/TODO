- allow twists: y^p = a*f, with f monic (done - more or less)
- take the right twist when making a coordinate change in x (done)
- solve the problem that sometimes irreducible polynomials have roots
  inside and outside the unit disk
- understand why the computation of the upper components takes so long
  (in the hyperelliptic example)
- realize loops in reduction_trees
- adapt the computation of the reduction genus and reduction conductor
- use verbose messages
