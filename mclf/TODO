- solve the problem that sometimes irreducible polynomials have roots
  inside and outside the unit disk (there is an ad hoc solution in superp, but
  we need something better)

- realize loops in reduction_trees
- adapt the computation of the reduction genus and reduction conductor

- use verbose messages

- computation of L-factors

- include the complement of the unit disk
