### ToDos for the branch padic_extensions ###

short term
==========

- improve fake_padic_embeddings:
  1. replace with padic_embeddings
  2. implement Newton approximation of generator
  3. compute approximate evaluation via linear maps over Z/p^N
  4. implement composition of embeddings

- improve fake_padic_extensions
  1. replace with padic_extensions
  2. clarify hierarchy and compatibility beetween padic number fields and extensions
  3. make sure weak splitting field is extension of the base field

- base change for points on the Berkovich line
  (needed for producing lower components of reduction trees)



middle term
