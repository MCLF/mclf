- find bugs in the following examples:
- Y = Superell(x^4+x^3+2*x^2+2*x, v_2, 3), Y.compute_semistable_reduction()
- Y = Superp(1+3*x^3+3*x^5, v_3, 3) , Y.conductor_exponent()

- solve the problem that sometimes irreducible polynomials have roots
  inside and outside the unit disk (there is an ad hoc solution in superp, but
  we need something better)

- realize loops in reduction_trees
- adapt the computation of the reduction genus and reduction conductor

- use verbose messages

- computation of L-factors

- include the complement of the unit disk
