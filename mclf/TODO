- when computing the genus of a component of a reduction tree, one has
  to take the degree of the extensions of the base field into account
  (try to allow to specify the constant base field in the definition
  of a curve; this is done on the branch "constant_base_field")
- implement my own 'weakly_separating_element' in 'SmoothProjectiveCurve'
