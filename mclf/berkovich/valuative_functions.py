r""" Valuative functions on the Berkovich projective line.
=========================================================

Let `K` be a field, `v_K` a discrete valuation on `K` and `X=\mathbb{P}^1_K`
the *Berkovich line* over `K`.

Let `f in F=K(x)` be a nonzero rational function. We associate to `f`
the function

..MATH::    H_f:X^{an} \to \RR\cup\{\pm\infty\},  \xi \mapsto v_\xi(f).


**Definition:** A *valuative function* on `X^{an}` is a function of the form

..MATH::      H = a_0 + \sum_i a_i\cdot H_{f_i}

where the `f_i` are irreducible polynomials in the parameter `x`,
and the `a_i` are rational numbers, with `a_i \neq 0` for `i > 0`.

Valuative functions are *harmonic* in the sense of [??]. In particular,
given a valuative function `H` on `X^{an}`, there always exists a Berkovich
tree `T` (see ??) such that `H` is an affine function on every edge of `|T|`.
Also, any refinement of `T` has the same property. We call `T` *compatible*
with `H`.

In this module we provide a class for working with valuative functions on the
Berkovich line.

EXAMPLES::

sage: from mclf import *
sage: F.<x> = FunctionField(QQ)
sage: X = BerkovichLine(F, QQ.valuation(2))

We can define a valuative function by a rational function on `X`::

sage: f = (x^2+2*x-2)/(2*x-1)
sage: H = ValuativeFunction(X, f)

We check that the value of `H` is the valuation of `f`, at several points::

sage: xi = X.gauss_point()
sage: H(xi), xi.v(f)
(0, 0)
sage: xi = X.infty()
sage: H(xi), xi.v(f)
(-Infinity, -Infinity)
sage: xi = X.point_from_discoid(x, 3)
sage: H(xi), xi.v(f)
(1, 1)

We can also define a valuative function by a pair `(L, a_0)`::

sage: L = [(x - 1, 2/3), (x + 1, 3/2)]
sage: a_0 = -3
sage: H = ValuativeFunction(X, (L, a_0))
sage: xi = X.point_from_discoid( x + 1, 2)
sage: H(xi)
2/3

We can compute the rational domain given by the inequality `H(\xi)\geq 0`::

sage: H.rational_domain()
Affinoid with 2 components:
Elementary affinoid defined by
v(x - 1) >= 9/4
Elementary affinoid defined by
v(x + 1) >= 14/9

class ValuativeFunction(SageObject):
    r""" A valuative function on the Berkovich line.

    INPUT:

    - ``X`` -- a Berkovich line
    - ``f`` -- a nonconstant rational function on `X`, or
               a pair `(L, a_0)`, where `L` is
                 a list of pairs `(g, a)`, or
                 a list of triples `(g, a, [\xi])`, consisting of
                 - a polynomial `g` (element of the function field on `X`)
                 - a nonzero rational number `a`, and *possibly*
                 - a list of type-I-points `[\xi]`, and
                `a_0` -is a rational number
    - ``root`` -- a point of type I or II, or ``None`` (default: ``None``)
    - ``assume_complete_factorization`` -- a Boolean (default: ``False``)

    OUTPUT: If `f` is a rational function, then we create the valuative function
    `H` defined as

    .. MATH::

        H(\xi) := v_K(f(\xi))

    If ``f`` is a pair `(L, a_0)` as above, where `L` is a list of pairs
    `(f_i, a_i)`, then the corresponding valuative function is defined as

    .. MATH::

        H(\xi) := a_0 + \sum_i a_i v(f(\xi)).

    The domain of `H` is either the full Berkovich line `X`, or a
    closed discoid `D`.

    If ``root`` is equal to the Gauss point (the default) then the domain is `X`.
    If ``root`` not equal to the Gauss point, then the domain is the closed
    diskoid `D` with boundary point ``root``. Recall that this is the set of all
    points on the Berkovich line which are `\geq ` to ``root`` with respect to
    the partial ordering.

    Note that ``root`` may be a point of type I (a minimal element). If this is
    the case, then the closed discoid degenerates to a single point and the
    valuative function is given by one value, possibly (and typically) equal to
    `\pm \infty`.

    If ``assume_complete_factorization`` is ``True`` then it is assumed that `f`
    is a pair `(L, a_0)`, and that the
    list `L` consists of triples `(f, a, [\xi])`, where the `f` are irreducible
    and pairwise prime, and `[\xi]` is the list of all zeroes of `f`.
