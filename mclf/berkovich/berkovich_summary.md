### 1. Pseudo-valuations

Let $F$ be a field. A map $v:F\to\mathbb{R}\cup\{\pm\infty\}$ is called a  *pseudo-valuation* if
1. $v(a\cdot b)=v(a)+v(b)$,
2. $v(a+b)\geq \min\{v(a),\,v(b)\}$,

for all $a,b\in F$. Note that the subset $R_v\subset F$ defined by the condition $v(a)>-\infty$ is a valuation ring with fraction field $F$. The subset $\mathfrak{m}_v\subset R$ defined by $v(a)=\infty$ is the maximal ideal of $R_v$. Moreover, $v$ induces an ordinary valuation
\[
    \bar{v}:\bar{F}:=R_v/\mathbb{m}_v\to\mathbb{R}\cup\{\infty\}.
\]
Note that $v$ is itself an ordinary valuation iff $R_v=F$ (and then $R_v$ is *not* the valuation ring of $v$!)


### 2. Points as pseudo-valuations ###

Let $K$ be a field endowed with a *discrete* valuation $v_K:K\to\mathbb{R}\cup\{\infty\}$.
We write $\mathcal{O}_K$ for the valuation ring of $v_K$, $\mathfrak{p}_K\lhd\mathcal{O}_K$ for the maximal ideal and $\mathbb{F}_K:=\mathcal{O}_K/\mathfrak{p}_K$ for the residue field. We also write $\hat{K}$ for the completion of $K$ with respect to $v_K$.  

We set $X:=\mathbb{P}^1_K$, and let $X^{an}$ denote the $K$-analytic space associated to $X$, in the sense of Berkovich.

Let $F$ denote the function field of $X$. Then $F=K(x)$, where $x$ is the natural parameter on $X$. We may identify points on $X^{an}$ with pseudo-valuations
$$
     v: F \to \mathbb{R} \cup\{\pm\infty\}
$$
extending $v_K$. Indeed, if $v(x)\neq -\infty$, then $|f|:=2^{-v(f)}$ defines a multiplicative seminorm $|\,\cdot\,|:K[x]\to\mathbb{R}$ on the polynomial ring in $x$, which defines a point on the Berkovich affine line (with parameter $x$). The unique point $\infty\in X^{an}$ which does not lie on the affine line corresponds to the pseudo-valuation $v_\infty$ extending $v_K$ with $v_\infty(x)=-\infty$.  

**Notation:**
Often we will denote a point on $X^{an}$ by some letter, say $\xi\in X^{an}$, and its corresponding pseudo-valuation by $v_\xi$. We write $\cal{H}(\xi)$ for the *residue field* of $\xi$. We recall that $\cal{H}(\xi)$ is the completion of $F_v=R_v/\mathfrak{m}_v$ with respect to $v$.

**Remark:** The Berkovich projective line $X^{an}$ is actually an analytic space over $\hat{K}$. So why do we not assume that $K$ is complete? Our point is that all the feature of $X^{an}$ which matter to us can be described
entirely by working with pseudo-valuation on $F=K(x)$.  

### 3. MacLane points ###

We will only be interested in two kind of points on $X^{an}$:

1. A point $\xi\in X^{an}$ is called *algebraic* if
the pseudo-valuation $v_\xi$ corresponding to $\xi$ is not a valuation (i.e. $v_\xi$ takes the value $-\infty$). This is the case iff $\cal{H}(\xi)$ is a finite extension of $\hat{K}$. In particular, an algebraic point is a point of *type I*, see [Berk] (but the converse is not true unless $K$ is complete and algebraically closed!).
2. A point $\xi\in X^{an}$ is called *of type II* if $v_\xi$ is a true valuation and the residue field $k_v$ is an extension of $\mathbb{F}_K$ of transcendence degree $1$ ([Berk]).

A point $\xi\in X^{an}$ is called a *MacLane point* if it is either algebraic or of type II.

**Proposition:** Assume that $\xi\in X^{an}$ lies in the closed unit disc (i.e. $v_\xi(x)\geq 0$). Then $\xi$ is a MacLane point if and only if the restriction of $v_\xi$ to $K[x]$ can be written as a an inductive pseudo-valuation, or as a limit valuation.

**Proof:** We consider $v=v_\xi$ as a pseudo-valuation on $K[x]$. If $v$ is a true valuation, our assumptions says that $\xi$ is a point of type II. This means that $v$ is a discrete valuation whose residue field is a function field of transcendence degree one over $\mathbb{F}_K$. Now the main result of [MacLane] shows that $v$ can be written as an inductive valuation (see also [Rueth]).

If $v$ is not a true valuation, then
\[
       I:=\{f\in K[x] \mid v(f) =\infty \}
\]
is a maximal ideal of $K[x]$ and hence generated by an irreducible monic polynomial $G\in K[x]$. This means that $v$ induces (and is induced by) an extension of $v_K$ to the finite extension
\[
     L:= K[x]/(G).
\]
Now ?? shows that $v$ can be presented as a limit valuation.                          
**qed**
